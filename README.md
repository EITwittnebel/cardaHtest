## Getting Started

Upon opening the app, an API request goes to imgur for the latest hot/viral images, and an alert is presented if a
connection is unavailable or some other error occurs. The results are presented in a collection view.


## Details Screen

If the user taps on an user from this collection, then they will be brought to a new screen that shows additional details
about the specified image. In particular, it will show the number of views, the score, and a link for that particular
image.


## Linkout

If the link is selected, then the app will open the imgur page for that repository.
